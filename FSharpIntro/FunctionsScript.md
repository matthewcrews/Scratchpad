Curried Form
Tuple form

## Part 2: Defining Functions

- Traditional
    - `let myFunc a b = //...`
- `fun` keyword
    - `let myFunc = fun a b -> //...`

    - Piping functions
- What is a higher-ordered function?
- Examples of using higher ordered functions
- When to NOT use Higher-Ordered functions?
- Performance implications of them
- `[<InlineIfLambda>]`

## Part 4: Function vs Method

- What is a Function really?
- How to tell the difference?
- When should you prefer one or the other?
- Which compiler is doing what work?
